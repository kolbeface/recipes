    <p>BEST Ever Chewy Brownies are just as chewy as boxed brownies but packed with so much more rich chocolate flavor. One bowl recipe, ready in less than 1 hour!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tblsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, cold</li>
        <li>1 tspn vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all -purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tspn salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Line an 8 by 8-inch light-colored metal pan*** with foil or parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, add the butter and sugar. Microwave for about 1 minute, or until the butter is melted. Whisk in the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in the oil and cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>With a rubber spatula, stir in the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the brownies are set and a cake tester inserted into the center has moist crumbs attached. Do not overcook. Let cool completely to solidify before cutting and serving.</li>
        <li>Brownies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Brownies will be gooey when served warm, chewy when served at room temperature, and fudgy when served chilled.</li>
